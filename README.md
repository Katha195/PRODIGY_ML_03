In this repository I have implemented a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. In machine learning, a support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful algorithm that can be used for various tasks including classification, regression, and even outlier detection. Here's a breakdown of what SVMs are good at:

Classification: This is where SVMs shine. They excel at finding the best separation line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to divide data points belonging to different classes.

High dimensional data: SVMs can handle data with many features effectively, which can be a challenge for some other algorithms.

Non-linear relationships: While SVMs themselves are linear models, they can be applied to non-linear problems through the use of kernel functions. These functions essentially project the data into a higher dimensional space where a linear separation is possible.

In this repository the dataset which has been used is taken from:
